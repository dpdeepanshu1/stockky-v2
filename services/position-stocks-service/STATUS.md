## Completed steps (tracking doc §5)

| Step | Item | Status | Notes |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Folder structure + docker-compose entry | ✅ DONE | `services/position-stocks-service/`, port 8006, compose entry added |
| 2 | Angel One true-WS client | ✅ DONE | `feed/ws_client.py` — binary frame parser, subscribe/heartbeat/reconnect; `feed/angelone_session.py` (duplicate of market-data-service session with feed_token surfaced); `feed/scrip_master.py` (duplicate of angelone_scrip_master.py) |
| 3 | Dhan symbol→security_id side-map | ✅ DONE | `execution/dhan_client.py` — full duplicate of real-trade-service's dhan_client.py with Super Order methods added; `auth/dhan_credentials_ro.py` — read-only credential reader |
| 4 | Rolling-window screening engine + composite ranking | ✅ DONE | `screening/engine.py` — in-memory ring buffer, 5m/15m/60m rolling pct-change, composite score, candidate dataclass |
| 5 | Super Order integration | ✅ DONE | `orders/entry.py` — gates → adaptive levels → capital sizing → place_super_order; `orders/adaptive.py` — adaptive target/stop formula; first-live-order qty=1 override wired in |
| 6 | ScalpCapitalLedger + 50/50 enforcement | ✅ DONE | `capital/ledger.py` — reserve/release capital, daily-loss kill switch, sync from Dhan fund balance |
| 7 | 3:00 PM square-off sweep + order budget guard | ✅ DONE | `orders/eod_squareoff.py`; order budget counter in ScalpGateState; Redis guard deferred (see Open Items) |
| — | Super Order exit reconciliation monitor | ✅ DONE (this session) | `orders/reconcile.py` — polls `dhan_client.get_super_order_list()` every trading-loop tick (runs even while disarmed), detects TARGET_LEG/STOP_LOSS_LEG fills + dead ENTRY_LEG rejections, closes the `ScalpPosition` row, calls `ledger.release_capital()`. Wired into `main.py`'s `_trading_loop()` (runs first, before the armed-gate check) and exposed as `POST /reconcile` for an on-demand pass. **Fill-price extraction on the exit legs is a best-effort guess** (Dhan's public sample payload doesn't show `averageTradedPrice` on nested `legDetails` entries) — flagged loudly in the module docstring; eyeball the first few real TARGET_HIT/STOP_HIT rows against Dhan's own app. |
| 8 | Frontend "Position Stocks" tab | ✅ DONE (this session) | `frontend/src/positionStocksApi.ts` (own client/own localStorage URL key, mirrors `realTradeApi.ts`'s isolation pattern) + `frontend/src/components/PositionStocksTab.tsx` (armed/market/WS/kill-switch strip, arm/disarm/kill/sync/reconcile buttons, capital ledger card, 5m/15m/60m screener grouped view, open + closed-today position lists). Wired into `App.tsx`: new `"positionstocks"` tab, nav item (📈 Position Stocks), command-palette entry. |
| 9 | RISK_PER_TRADE_PCT from user | ⏳ OPEN | User has not yet confirmed the % of scalp pool to risk per trade. Placeholder 1.5% active — now also surfaced as a warning banner in the new frontend tab, not just the startup log line. |

```

Everything from the previous session (folder structure, WS client, Dhan side-map,
screening engine, Super Order integration, capital ledger, EOD sweep) is unchanged —
see the table above for those.

---

## Open items

1. **RISK_PER_TRADE_PCT** — user must confirm the % of scalp pool to risk per trade.
   Until then, `RISK_PER_TRADE_PCT=1.5` (placeholder) and `RISK_PER_TRADE_PCT_CONFIRMED=false`
   — service logs a loud warning on every startup, and the frontend tab now also shows
   this as a banner at the top of the Position Stocks page. **This is the one thing
   genuinely still needed from the user before this can be trusted at real position size.**

2. **Shared Redis order counter** (tracking doc §3.8) — the shared Dhan account-wide
   order budget is currently enforced per-service only (ScalpGateState.orders_placed_today).
   A shared Redis counter that both real-trade-service and position-stocks-service increment
   is deferred. Low urgency until order volumes get large.

3. **Exit-leg fill price is a best-effort guess** (see `orders/reconcile.py` docstring) —
   Dhan's public API sample doesn't document an `averageTradedPrice` field on the nested
   `legDetails` dicts for TARGET_LEG/STOP_LOSS_LEG, only on the top-level entry leg. The
   monitor tries several plausible field names and falls back to the leg's static
   trigger price, which is close but not guaranteed exact. **Recommended: after the
   first few real exits fire, compare the booked `realized_pnl` in `/positions` against
   Dhan's own order history for those same trades** — if they match, this is a non-issue;
   if not, the field name needs adjusting (quick fix, one function).

4. **No frontend test run yet** — `node_modules` isn't present in this sandbox (no
   network egress), so `PositionStocksTab.tsx`/`positionStocksApi.ts`/`App.tsx` were
   checked for brace/paren balance and structural consistency with the existing
   `RealAutoTrade.tsx`/`realTradeApi.ts` pattern, but never run through `tsc` or Vite.
   **Run `npm install && npm run build` (or `vite dev`) once on your machine/VM before
   deploying** to catch anything a static read-through would miss.

---

## Next steps (in priority order)

1. **Get RISK_PER_TRADE_PCT from the user** (open item #1, tracking doc §3.5/§5.9) —
   the last real open item. Once given, set `RISK_PER_TRADE_PCT=<value>` and
   `RISK_PER_TRADE_PCT_CONFIRMED=true` in the service's env and redeploy.
2. **Build + smoke-test the frontend** (`cd frontend && npm install && npm run build`)
   and eyeball `PositionStocksTab.tsx` against a running (or at least DEMO-armed)
   `position-stocks-service` instance.
3. **First live Super Order** — with `FIRST_LIVE_ORDER_MIN_QTY_OVERRIDE=true` (default),
   arm the service during market hours and watch the very first real entry fire at
   qty=1. Confirm the fill shape matches expectations, then flip the override off.
4. Shared Redis order-count guard (open item #2) — deferred, low urgency.
